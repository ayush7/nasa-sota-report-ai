      "Answer: An ESPA-class satellite refers to a type of satellite that utilizes the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (SPA) or similar configurations. The ESPA ring, which is a key component of ESPA-class satellites, allows for the separation of the primary payload from the upper stage of the launch vehicle, enabling additional mounting allocations for secondary payloads. These secondary payloads can be mounted on the ESPA ring, providing opportunities for rideshare missions. ESPA-class satellites are designed to accommodate secondary payloads with masses typically under 500 kg, although some variants of the ESPA ring can support higher masses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of peak power range in watts, ESPA-class satellites have a variety of power outputs depending on the specific satellite. The peak power output can range from as low as 80 watts to as high as 4,500 watts. Among the satellites listed in the provided information, the satellite with the highest peak power output is the CesiumAstro satellite from the United States, which has a peak power output of 4,500 watts.\n",

      "ESPAClass satellites represent a versatile category of satellites that leverage the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (SPA) or similar configurations. These satellites are designed to accommodate secondary payloads, providing opportunities for rideshare missions and enabling cost-effective access to space for smaller payloads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Features of ESPA-Class Satellites:\n",
      "1. ESPA Ring: The ESPA ring is a critical component of ESPA-class satellites, facilitating the separation of primary and secondary payloads.\n",
      "2. Secondary Payload Mounting: ESPA-class satellites allow for additional mounting allocations for secondary payloads, enhancing the flexibility of launch missions.\n",
